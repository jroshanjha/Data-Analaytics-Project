# Retail Customer Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of two popular recommendation system techniques for an e-commerce retail application:

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Using customer purchase history and ratings to predict which products a user is likely to enjoy.
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzing product attributes and a user's preferences to suggest items similar to ones they've liked in the past.

The goal is to provide personalized product recommendations to customers, leading to increased sales, customer satisfaction, and loyalty.

## Data Preprocessing
- Import necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn, surprise)
- Load sample customer purchase data, product information, and user ratings
- Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and engineer relevant features

## Collaborative Filtering
### User-Item Rating Matrix
- Create a sparse user-item rating matrix from the purchase data
- Impute missing ratings using techniques like mean imputation

### Model Training
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Train a collaborative filtering model using the Surprise library
  - Experiment with different algorithms like SVD, KNN, and NMF
  - Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance

### Recommendation Generation
- Given a target user, use the trained model to predict ratings for unseen items
- Recommend the top-N items with the highest predicted ratings for the user

## Content-Based Filtering
### Feature Engineering
- Extract relevant product attributes (e.g., category, brand, price, description)
- Represent products as feature vectors using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings

### Model Training
- Train a cosine similarity model to find products similar to a user's favorite items
- Optionally, train a classification model to predict a user's product preferences based on their profile

### Recommendation Generation
- Given a target user and their preferred products, use the content-based model to recommend similar items
- Combine collaborative and content-based recommendations for a hybrid approach

## Deployment
- Package the recommendation models as reusable Python modules
- Integrate the models into an e-commerce web application or provide an API for other teams to access the functionality
- Monitor model performance and update the models periodically as new data becomes available

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged to build personalized recommendation systems for retail e-commerce applications. 
By combining collaborative and content-based filtering techniques, 
businesses can provide customers with highly relevant product suggestions, leading to increased sales, customer satisfaction, and loyalty.
