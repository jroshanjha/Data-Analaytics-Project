What is DDL? List some common DDL commands.

Answer: DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a set of SQL statements that are used to create, modify, and remove database objects. DDL is a subset of SQL, and is similar to a computer programming language for defining data structures.

Common DDL commands are:
CREATE: To create new tables, views, indexes, etc.
ALTER: To modify existing database structures, such as adding columns to a table.
DROP: To delete objects, like tables or indexes.
TRUNCATE: To quickly remove all records from a table without logging each row deletion.
RENAME: To rename a database object, such as a table or column.
