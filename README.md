from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10  # Feature
y = 3 * X.flatten() + np.random.randn(100) * 5  # Target with noise

# Convert to DataFrame
data = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': X.flatten(), 'Target': y})


# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Print performance
print("Mean Squared Error (MSE):", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))



# Add a constant for the intercept
X_with_const = sm.add_constant(X)

# Fit the regression model
ols_model = sm.OLS(y, X_with_const).fit()

# Print the summary
print(ols_model.summary())
