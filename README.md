# Python Data Analysis Interview Questions:- 

1. **What are the main data structures in Python, and how do you choose between them?**
   (Discuss lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and when to use each)

2. **How do you handle missing data in a Pandas DataFrame?**
   (Explain methods like `dropna()`, `fillna()`, `interpolate()`)

3. **Explain the difference between the .loc[] and .iloc[] indexers in Pandas.**

4. **How would you merge two DataFrames in Pandas?**
   (Discuss `merge()`, `join()`, and different join types)

5. **What are the main functions in NumPy?**
   (Mention functions like `np.array()`, `np.mean()`, `np.sum()`, `np.sqrt()`)

6. **How would you plot a simple line chart using Matplotlib?**

7. **What is the difference between Pandas' Series and DataFrame?**

8. **How would you handle categorical data in a machine learning pipeline?**
   (Discuss techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding)

9. **Explain the train-test split and its importance in machine learning.**

10. **What is the purpose of feature scaling in machine learning?**
    (Discuss techniques like StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler)

11. **How would you handle an imbalanced dataset in a classification problem?**
    (Mention techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights)

12. **Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization in machine learning.**

13. **What is the purpose of the `groupby()` function in Pandas?**
    (Discuss grouping and aggregating data)

14. **How would you handle large datasets that don't fit into memory?**
    (Mention techniques like chunking, online learning, or out-of-core processing)

15. **What are some common data cleaning tasks in Python?**
    (Discuss handling missing values, removing duplicates, dealing with outliers, etc.)
