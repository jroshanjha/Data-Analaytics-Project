# Data-Analaytics-Project
This repository for Data Analytics Project Uses Python ( Numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib and scipy ) and SQL.

# Machine Learning Project:- 
Regression and Classification, Neural Network and  NLP for text classification 

##  Libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import statsmodels.api as sm
import scipy.stats as stats


# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 10  # Feature
y = 3 * X.flatten() + np.random.randn(100) * 5  # Target with noise

# Convert to DataFrame
data = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': X.flatten(), 'Target': y})


# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Print performance
print("Mean Squared Error (MSE):", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))



# Add a constant for the intercept
X_with_const = sm.add_constant(X)

# Fit the regression model
ols_model = sm.OLS(y, X_with_const).fit()

# Print the summary
print(ols_model.summary())



# Python Data Analysis Interview Questions:- 

1. **What are the main data structures in Python, and how do you choose between them?**
   (Discuss lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and when to use each)

2. **How do you handle missing data in a Pandas DataFrame?**
   (Explain methods like `dropna()`, `fillna()`, `interpolate()`)

3. **Explain the difference between the .loc[] and .iloc[] indexers in Pandas.**

4. **How would you merge two DataFrames in Pandas?**
   (Discuss `merge()`, `join()`, and different join types)

5. **What are the main functions in NumPy?**
   (Mention functions like `np.array()`, `np.mean()`, `np.sum()`, `np.sqrt()`)

6. **How would you plot a simple line chart using Matplotlib?**

7. **What is the difference between Pandas' Series and DataFrame?**

8. **How would you handle categorical data in a machine learning pipeline?**
   (Discuss techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding)

9. **Explain the train-test split and its importance in machine learning.**

10. **What is the purpose of feature scaling in machine learning?**
    (Discuss techniques like StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler)

11. **How would you handle an imbalanced dataset in a classification problem?**
    (Mention techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights)

12. **Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization in machine learning.**

13. **What is the purpose of the `groupby()` function in Pandas?**
    (Discuss grouping and aggregating data)

14. **How would you handle large datasets that don't fit into memory?**
    (Mention techniques like chunking, online learning, or out-of-core processing)

15. **What are some common data cleaning tasks in Python?**
    (Discuss handling missing values, removing duplicates, dealing with outliers, etc.)
